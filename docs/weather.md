# Weather

ApexGPS can show current conditions, an hour-by-hour outlook, and a 7-day outlook for any point you care about.

## What you'll see

Weather is **on by default** as of 1.32.2. As soon as you have a GPS fix:

- A small chip appears above the stats bar showing the conditions at your current location.
- Tapping a waypoint shows a "Weather here" line on the waypoint panel.
- Tapping either surface opens a sheet with the full breakdown.

When weather is on, your latitude / longitude is sent to Open-Meteo (a free public weather API) for each forecast lookup. If you'd rather no network calls leave the app, open **Settings → Weather** and switch off **Show weather** — the chip and "Weather here" line disappear and ApexGPS stops contacting Open-Meteo.

## What the chip shows

The chip rotates between a few states:

| State | Looks like | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh | a weather icon, then `24° · 12 km/h NE` | Updated within the last 15 minutes. |
| Aging | `… · 32 min ago` | More than 15 minutes old, but still likely accurate. |
| Stale / offline | `⚠ … · 2h ago` (greyed) | More than an hour old or no connectivity. Tap the chip to refresh manually. |

The chip never disappears once weather is on — it just changes its appearance to tell you how trustworthy the data is.

## The forecast sheet

Tap the chip (or the "Weather here" line on a waypoint) to open the full sheet. Top-to-bottom it shows:

- **Now** — a large weather icon + temperature, "feels like", and a row each for wind / humidity + max precip / dewpoint + UV / pressure + sunset.
- **Forecast strip with a 24h / 8h / 2h toggle** — eight icons (day or night depending on the local sunrise / sunset for that step) with the temperature, and the **chance of precipitation** underneath. The percentage only appears from 20 % upwards, so a dry forecast stays uncluttered. The small toggle above the strip switches the window:
  - **24h** — the whole day at a glance, one cell every 3 hours.
  - **8h** — the next eight hours, one cell per hour.
  - **2h** — the next two hours in 15-minute steps, for catching a shower or storm that's about to arrive (it can show the change up to ~45 minutes before the hourly view does). The **2h** option appears where 15-minute data is available (most of Europe and North America); elsewhere you'll see just **24h** and **8h**.
- **Pressure trend** (green) — 24-hour line chart, useful for spotting an approaching front.
- **Humidity trend** (light blue) — 24-hour line chart.
- **Next 7 days** — a row of weekday icons with the day's high / low temperature, and the chance of precipitation where it reaches 20 % or more.

There's a refresh button (↻) in the sheet header that bypasses the cache and fetches fresh data. If you're offline, the previous data stays on screen and the chip's stale indicator stays visible.

## Elevation-aware forecasts on peaks

If a waypoint has a stored elevation (entered manually, set from GPS, or imported from a GPX with `<ele>`), that elevation is sent to Open-Meteo so the model knows it's a summit and not a valley point at the same lat / lon. The same applies to the chip: it uses your GPS altitude. On a 1500 m peak this typically corrects the forecast temperature by ~9 °C compared to a coordinates-only lookup.

## Auto-refresh

The current-location forecast appears as soon as you open the map (it uses your last known position so it doesn't wait for a full GPS lock, then sharpens to your exact spot and elevation once a fix lands). After that it refreshes when you **open the forecast sheet**, when you tap the **↻ refresh button**, and **automatically every 15 minutes** while weather is on, you have a live location, and you're online. It does not refresh on every step you take, and it never contacts the network while you're offline — the chip simply keeps the last data with its "… ago" age until you reconnect or refresh.

## Reading the icons

The weather symbols are drawn by ApexGPS itself, so they look **exactly the same on every phone**. Colour carries
meaning at a glance:

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Blue | Precipitation — drizzle, rain, sleet or snow |
| Amber | Clear skies (the sun; at night a clear sky shows a plain grey moon) |
| Grey | Cloud or fog |
| Red | Thunderstorm |

Icon detail matches the forecast: light rain, rain and heavy rain are three different symbols, as are snow, heavy
snow and sleet. Because the chance of precipitation is also printed as a number, you never have to rely on reading a
small symbol alone.

Up to version 1.47.1 these symbols were emoji supplied by the phone itself, which meant two phones could show
different pictures — or none at all — for the very same forecast. That is fixed as of 1.48.0.

## Data sources

Forecasts come from **[Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com)**, a free public API that blends ECMWF, GFS, ICON and other top-tier global models. Free for personal use, no account, no API key.

## Limitations

- **Convective rain in arid regions** is hard to predict for any model. Expect occasional misses on flash-flood thunderstorms in places like the UAE Hajar mountains. The probability number is honest about this, but localised events can land off-grid.
- **Severe-weather alerts** are not part of this feature. ApexGPS doesn't broadcast push notifications when storms approach.
- **Route weather** isn't supported — forecasts are point lookups, not "what's the weather along this trail in 2 hours". You can tap individual waypoints along a route to spot-check.
